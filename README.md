<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>
  The Ultimate Portfolio app is a sample app written with SwiftUI to demonstrate IOS development skills.
The app has been worked on as a standard project with each iteration of development being applied throuhg a 
GIT repository again for the purpose of demonstration.

<p>
The app itself is a simple to-do management utility for recording and keeping track of projects and items
that compose the projects. Projects are either open or closed with associated items either completed or
still in progress.
